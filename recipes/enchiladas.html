  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or other cooking oil</li>
    <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
    <li>1/2 onion, chopped (about 3/4 cup)</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced (about 1 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>1 (14-ounce can) crushed tomatoes, preferably fire roasted
    </li>
    <li>3/4 cup chopped cooked green chiles
    </li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 pound (4 cups) jack cheese, mild cheddar , or a mix, grated</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>Handful cilantro</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Coat large saute pan with oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Brown chicken over medium heat, allow 7 minutes each side or until no longer pink. Sprinkle chicken with cumin, garlic powder and Mexican spices before turning. Remove chicken to a platter, allow to cool.
    </li>
    <li>Saute onion and garlic in chicken drippings until tender. Add corn and chiles. Stir well to combine. Add canned tomatoes, saute 1 minute.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pull chicken breasts apart by hand into shredded strips. Add shredded chicken to saute pan, combine with vegetables. Dust the mixture with flour to help set.
    </li>
    <li>
      Microwave tortillas on high for 30 seconds. This softens them and makes them more pliable. Coat the bottom of 2 (13 by 9-inch) pans with a ladle of enchilada sauce. Using a large shallow bowl, dip each tortilla in enchilada sauce to lightly coat. Spoon 1/4 cup chicken mixture in each tortilla. Fold over filling, place 8 enchiladas in each pan with seam side down. Top with remaining enchilada sauce and cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated 350 degree F oven until cheese melts. Garnish with cilantro, scallion, sour cream and chopped tomatoes before serving. Serve with Spanish rice and beans.
